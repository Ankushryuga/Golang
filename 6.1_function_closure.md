# Go Function closure: is a function value that references variables from outside its body, the closures bind these variables and make them accessible even after closing the outer function.


# Creating a closure:
    => A closure is created when an inner function captures and retains access to the variables of its enclosing function.
    # Example:

    counter := func() func() int {
        count := 0
        //this is closure
        return func() int {
            count++
            return count
        }
    }
    //use: 
    increment := counter()
