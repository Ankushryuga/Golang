/**
A worker pool in Go is a concurrency pattern used to efficiently manage a set of goroutines(workers) that process jobs from a shared queue(channel).
It helps control resource usage and avoid spawning an unbounded number of goroutines.
###### Why use a worker pool?
  - To limit the number of goroutines doing work concurrently.
  - To reuse worker goroutines for processing multiple jobs.
  - To handle large numbers of tasks efficiently and safely.
  - To implement rate limiting, throttling, or bounded concurrency.

####### Basic structure of a worker pool:
  - Job channel: A channel to send work to the workers.
  - Worker goroutines: Fixed number of goroutines that process jobs from the channel.
  - Result channel(optional): A channel to collect the output of each job.


üîç Breakdown of the Example
jobs is a buffered channel carrying integers (jobs).

results is where each worker sends back its result.

worker() runs as a goroutine and loops over the jobs channel.

We spawn 3 worker goroutines.

After sending all jobs, we close(jobs) so workers know when to stop.

The main goroutine collects the results after all jobs are processed.

| Concept            | Explanation                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Goroutines         | Lightweight threads to run workers                     |
| Channel            | Used to distribute work and gather results             |
| Close jobs channel | Prevents deadlocks; tells workers there‚Äôs no more work |
| Blocking behavior  | Workers block on `range jobs`, waiting for work        |
| Efficiency         | Limits concurrency to a fixed number (`numWorkers`)    |

üèóÔ∏è Variations
Context for cancellation: Use context.Context to cancel workers on timeout or signal.

Rate limiting: Add delays or use time.Ticker inside workers.

Error handling: Add an error channel or wrap results in structs like type JobResult struct.

    jobs <- j

  close(jobs)  //important close the job channel to signal no more jobs.
  //collect result.
