## Marshaling:
        Marshaling is the process of converting a Go object into JSON (or another format)..
        =>
            type User struct{
                Name string    `json:"name"`
                Age int        `json:"age"`
            } 
            func main(){
                u := User{Name:"Ankush", Age:25}
                data, err := json.Marshal(u)
                if err!=nil{
                    panic(err)
                }
                fmt.Println(string(data))    //o/p: {"name":"Ankush", "age":25}
            }
            # ðŸŸ¢ json.Marshal() returns a []byte, which is typically converted to a string.

# Unmarshaling:
Unmarshaling is the process of parsing JSON into a Go Struct or variable.
        =>
        jsonData := `{"name":"Bob", "age":25}`

        var u User 
        err := json.Unmarshal([]byte(jsonData), &u)        //unmarshaling..
        if err!=nil{
            panic(err)
        }
        fmt.Println(u.Name, u.Age)    

        # json.Unmarshal() takes a byte slice and a pointer to the variable where data should be loaded.. 

| Term      | Description | Analogy              |
| --------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| Marshal   | Go â†’ JSON   | Packing into a box   |
| Unmarshal | JSON â†’ Go   | Unpacking from a box |

# Use Tags for JSON field names:
    type Person struct{
        FirstName string    `json:"first_name"`    //maps to "first_name" in JSON.
    }
# Custom Marshal/Unmarshal (like with Enums)
        - You can implement:    
            - MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error)
            - UnmarshalJSON([]byte) error

To control how a type is converted to/from JSON.
# MarshalIndent() for pretty JSON.
    data, _ := json.MarshalIndent(u, "", " ")
    fmt.Println(string(data))

## 1. Understand Slices vs Arrays
Slices are references to underlying arrays with three components: pointer to array, length, and capacity.
Modifying elements of a slice modifies the underlying array, so be mindful of shared references.
## 2. Initialize Slices Appropriately
Use make to create slices with predefined length and capacity:
s := make([]int, 0, 10)  // length=0, capacity=10
This avoids repeated reallocations and copy when appending elements.
## 3. Use append Correctly
append adds elements to a slice and returns a new slice:
s = append(s, 42)
Always assign the result back to the slice variable, since the underlying array may change on capacity expansions.
## 4. Be Cautious About Slice Capacity and Memory Leaks
Slicing a large slice to a smaller one keeps references to the original underlying array, potentially causing unintended memory retention.
To avoid this, consider copying:
newSlice := make([]T, len(smallSlice))
copy(newSlice, smallSlice)
This is helpful if the large slice holds much memory and you want to release it.
## 5. Avoid Using Nil Slices Where Possible
Nil slices behave similarly to empty slices in most cases, but being explicit can help readability:
var s []int  // nil slice
s = []int{}  // empty slice, safer for JSON marshaling/readability
## 6. Use copy for Efficient Data Copies
To copy data between slices, use the copy built-in function, which copies as many elements as the minimum of both slice lengths:
copy(dest, src)
## 7. Don't Modify Slices While Iterating (Carefully)
If you append or modify the slice inside a for-range loop, it may yield unexpected behavior. Prefer iterating on a known fixed length or use caution.
## 8. Choosing Between Slices and Arrays
Use arrays primarily for fixed-length data known at compile time.
Slices should be the default option due to flexibility.
## 9. Avoid Overusing [:] Slicing
Using slicing expressions (s[start:end]) creates a slice referencing the same underlying array, which means changes affect all referencing slices.
Be aware of this especially when passing slices around in your programs.
## 10. Use Third-Party Libraries or Generics for More Complex Slice Operations
With Go 1.18+, generics allow writing reusable functions operating over slices of any type, improving code reusability.
Example for generic function to filter slice elements:
func Filter[T any](s []T, f func(T) bool) []T {
    var result []T
    for _, v := range s {
        if f(v) {
            result = append(result, v)
        }
    }
    return result
}
Summary
Initialize slices with capacity when possible.
Always assign after append.
Be mindful of shared underlying arrays and memory usage.
Use copy for making independent copies.
Favor slices over arrays in most practical applications.
Leverage new language features like generics for advanced operations.
