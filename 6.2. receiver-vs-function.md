# Receiver or function methods:
    => it is associated with type, used to define behaviour on structs or custom types.

    #example:
    type Person struct {
    Name string
    }
    func (p Person) Greet() {
        fmt.Println("Hello, my name is", p.Name)
    }
    # Receivers can be:
    1. Value receivers: (p Person)
    2. Pointer receivers: (p *Person)

    # Use pointer receivers when:
    1. You want to modify the original object.
    2. The struct is large and you want to avoid copying.

# Regular methods:
    =>
    These are standalone functions not tied to a type. You pass any values (like structs) as parameters.

    type Person struct {
    Name string
    }

    func Greet(p Person) {
        fmt.Println("Hello, my name is", p.Name)
    }

| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Association              | Attached to a type (like a method) | Not associated with any type |
| Syntax                   | `func (t Type) MethodName()`       | `func FunctionName(t Type)`  |
| Inheritance / Interfaces | Can implement interfaces           | Cannot implement interfaces  |
| Usage style              | `obj.Method()`                     | `Function(obj)`              |
| Common use               | Behaviors on types (e.g. structs)  | Utility or helper functions  |
