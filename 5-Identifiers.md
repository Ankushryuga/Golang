# Identifier:    
    => An identifier in Go is a name given to a variable, function, constant, type, or any other user-defined item. It is used to refer to the item in the code. 
       Identifiers in Go are case-sensitive, meaning that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different. For example, "myVariable" and "MyVariable" 
       are two different identifiers in Go.

# Example:
    => 
      package main
      import "fmt"
      var myVariable int
      const pi = 3.14
      func myFunction() {}
      
      type person struct {
        name string
        age int
      }

      func main(){
      fmt.println("Hello world");
      }
