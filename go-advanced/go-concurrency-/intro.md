| **Definition** | Structuring a program to handle multiple tasks at once (not necessarily simultaneously) | Executing multiple tasks at the *same time* on multiple processors/cores       |
| **Focus**      | Dealing with lots of things at once                                                     | Doing lots of things at once                                                   |
| **Example**    | A single-core CPU switching between tasks quickly (interleaving)                        | Multi-core CPU running multiple tasks truly simultaneously                     |
| **Go Usage**   | Achieved using `goroutines` and `channels` to coordinate tasks                          | If goroutines are scheduled on multiple threads/cores, Go achieves parallelism |
| **Analogy**    | A chef cooking several dishes by switching between them                                 | Multiple chefs cooking several dishes at the same time                         |
