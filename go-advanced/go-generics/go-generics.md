# Go Generics: it enable the creation of functions and data structures that operate on a variety of types without sacrificing type safety:


# Key concepts:
    1. Type Parameters: Generic functions and types declare type parameters within square brackets [] after their name, these parameters act as placeholder for concrete types.
    #Example:
    
    func printSlice[T any](s []T){
        for _, v := range s {
            fmt.Println(v)
        }
    }
    //T is a type parameter, and any is predeclared constraint that allows any type.
    1. constraints: Type parameters can be constrained to a specific set of types that implement certain methods.
